## Resources

The Greensock docs and forums are brilliant.

[Getting started](https://greensock.com/get-started/)

[GSAP 3 docs ](https://greensock.com/docs/)

[Forums](https://greensock.com/forums/) â€” Like stack overflow, but the people aren't horrid.

## Why Greensock? <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

> There are a lot of JS animation libraries to choose from. Greensock is the only one that handles SVG transforms consistently cross browser.

They also go above and beyond to fix bugs and edge cases. Safari has had a bug since 2012 that causes 3D transform-origin values not to render properly. GSAP works around it internally to correct things.

### TL:DR <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

- Consistent handling of transforms.
- Dependable, It's been around since the flash days.
- SVG specific plugins
- Supportive forums
- Great documentation and examples on codepen
- Great browser support - IE9+
- Not just for SVG, use GSAP for DOM, canvas, three.js (anything with numbers)
