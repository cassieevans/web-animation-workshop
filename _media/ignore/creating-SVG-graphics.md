[This article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/07/flat-vector-illustration-affinity-designer/#top) is a great place to start if you want to give illustration a go!

### Alternatives to drawing

- Team up with a designer or illustrator you know.
- Found something you like online? Contact the artist and ask if you can animate it for them.
- Animate simple shapes.
- Download Vector art [online](https://www.freepik.com/).

## Optional homework

On day 3 and 4 we'll be getting into animation!
I'll provide an SVG, but if you'd like to create or source your own, go for it!
