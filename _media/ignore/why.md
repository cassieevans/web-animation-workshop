My main reason for animating on the web is to make people smile

Unlike animations exported out as videos or gifs, when you animate with code, other people can interact with your animation.

Being able to factor in external interaction encourages an extra level of playfulness that you don't get with traditional methods of animation.

Plus, it's mega fun. We have _**all sorts of cool stuff**_ to play with in the browser. We can animate on user interaction like hover or scroll, hook into API's, even mess about with web audio or input from hardware.

But animation has genuine benefits to an online experience too.

# What your boss cares about {docsify-ignore-all}

- Better engagement metrics
- Animation can reduce cognitive load and guide users around an interface.
- It can provide feedback on interactions.
- Visual feedback makes layout changes easier to understand.
- It can improve perceived performance.

# Why SVG?

- SVG is built for drawing on the web.
- SVG graphics are basically illustrations that you can manipulate with code.
- They're easier to debug than canvas.
- SVG falls back nicely to an illustration without JS. (yay progressive enhancement!)
- Can be nested inside semantic HTML.
- Can be made accessible for screenreaders.
- Good for infographics, logos, text & microinteractions.
- Loads of fun.
