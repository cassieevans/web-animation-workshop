Hey SVG crew! I'm SO excited to have you along on this adventure with me.

As we go through the workshop, keep these docs to hand. I've made _all_ the notes so you don't have to. There are handy resources, code snippets and links to the starter pens you'll need for the exercises.

If you get stuck or have any questions, don't feel afraid to speak up! There are no silly questions. ðŸ’œ

## You will need <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

**A working laptop.**

**A modern browser, I recommend Chrome or firefox.**

**A codepen account** Weâ€™ll be using codepen for the exercises. If you donâ€™t have one already, you can make one for free [here](https://codepen.io/)

ðŸš¨ If codepen is down there are emergency files [here](https://we.tl/t-a2gQe8H8l9)

## Optional <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

**Graphics editing software.** I use Illustrator, but I know the pricing on adobe software is a **_bit much_** for some folks. Affinity designer is a brilliant alternative. - You can get a free trial [here](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/#buy)
