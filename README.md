Hey SVG Crew! I'm SO excited to have you along on this adventure with me.

As we go through the workshop, keep these docs to hand. I'll be adding notes for each session so you don't have to. There will be handy resources, and links to the starter pens you'll need for the exercises.

If you get stuck or have any questions, don't feel afraid to unmute and speak up! If that's a bit intimidating, comment in the chat, I'll keep an eye on it.
