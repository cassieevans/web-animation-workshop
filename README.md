Hey Smashing-SVG Crew! I'm SO excited to have you along on this adventure with me.

As we go through this workshop, keep these docs to hand!

I'll be adding notes for each session so you don't have to, there are handy resources, and also links to the starter pens you'll need for the exercises.

If you get stuck or have any questions, hit that big old help button. It'll open a google doc where you can write your question. I'll be keeping an eye on it.

If you know the answer to a question you see on there, feel free to answer and help each other out!

## You will need <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

**A working laptop.**

**A modern browser, I recommend Chrome or firefox.**

**A codepen account** We’ll be using codepen for the exercises, so you’ll need a codepen account. If you don’t have one already, you can make one for free [here](https://codepen.io/)

<!-- **Slack** If you have questions, get stuck during an exercise or want to share what you're working on, [this is the place!](https://join.slack.com/t/svg-animation/shared_invite/enQtOTU2MjM2MTUyNDcwLThkZDFiZTBhNzE4Mzc5YjAzODU0MzRmMDRjMzFiNGVjNmUxYTI1Njk5NTk3N2FjZWE3ZjQ4ZDA3MjdmMDU3OWQ) I'll be keeping this slack channel running after the workshop too. So _hopefully_ we'll get a little creative community going.

**Graphics editing software.** You can get a free trial for Affinity designer [here](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/#buy) -->
