Hey crew! I'm excited to have you along on this adventure with me.

As we go along today keep these docs to hand! Each section of the workshop is accessible from the sidebar, the resources, exercises, and notes (where applicable) are outlined in each section.

## You will need:

**A working laptop.**

**Graphics editing software.** You can get a free trial for Affinity designer [here](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/#buy)

**SVG graphics (optional)** I’ll be providing everyone with SVG’s to animate, but if you have your own that's great!

**A codepen account** We’ll be using codepen for the exercises, so you’ll need a codepen account. If you don’t have one already, you can make one for free [here](https://codepen.io/)

**Slack** If you have questions, get stuck during an exercise or want to share what you're working on, [this is the place!](https://join.slack.com/t/svg-animation/shared_invite/enQtOTU2MjM2MTUyNDcwLThkZDFiZTBhNzE4Mzc5YjAzODU0MzRmMDRjMzFiNGVjNmUxYTI1Njk5NTk3N2FjZWE3ZjQ4ZDA3MjdmMDU3OWQ) I'll be keeping this slack channel running after the workshop too. So _hopefully_ we'll get a little creative community going.
