## You will need:

__A working laptop.__

__Graphics editing software.__ You can get a free trial for Affinity designer [here](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/#buy)

__SVG graphics (optional)__ I’ll be providing everyone with SVG’s to animate, but if you have your own that's great!

__A codepen account__ We’ll be using codepen for the exercises, so you’ll need a codepen account. If you don’t have one already, you can make one for free [here](https://codepen.io/)

__Slack__ If you have questions, get stuck during an exercise or want to share what you're working on, [this is the place!](https://join.slack.com/t/svg-animation/shared_invite/enQtOTU2MjM2MTUyNDcwLThkZDFiZTBhNzE4Mzc5YjAzODU0MzRmMDRjMzFiNGVjNmUxYTI1Njk5NTk3N2FjZWE3ZjQ4ZDA3MjdmMDU3OWQ) I'll be keeping this slack channel running after the workshop too. So _hopefully_ we'll get a little creative community going.
