Thanks for coming along on this SVG journey with me!

I hope you had fun! If you have any questions, [pop me a message anytime](mailto:hi@cassie.codes).

I have a little SVG animation slack channel [here](https://join.slack.com/t/svg-animation/shared_invite/zt-ld8zodr8-logjxuHIrrssl7EbB_XJHg). Join us, share what you're working on and we can help each other when we get stuck!

I also have a monthly [SVG newsletter](https://viewbox.club/) full of demos and tips and tricks.

If you have time, I'd love it if you could give me [some feedback on this workshop](https://www.cassie.codes/feedback/).

Happy animating!

xx Cassie
