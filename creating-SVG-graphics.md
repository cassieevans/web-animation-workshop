[This article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/07/flat-vector-illustration-affinity-designer/#top) is a great place to start if you want to learn how to create more complex graphics.

### Don't want to draw something yourself?

* Team up with a designer or illustrator you know.
* Found something you like online? Contact the artist and ask if you can animate it for them.
* Download Vector art online.

## Exercise

Find an SVG on Freepik or if you'd prefer, draw out some simple shapes to animate.
(If you brought along your own SVG you can use that.)
