You don't have to be great at drawing to get started with SVG animation. Practice makes perfect, and simple can be effective.

[This article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/07/flat-vector-illustration-affinity-designer/#top) is a great place to start if you want to give illustration a go!

[And here's a fun game](https://bezier.method.ac/) to help you master the pen tool.

### Alternatives to drawing

- Team up with a designer or illustrator you know.
- Found something you like online? Contact the artist and ask if you can animate it for them.
- Animate simple shapes.
- Download Vector art [online](https://www.freepik.com/).

## Optional homework

On day 3 and 4 we'll be getting into animation!

I'll provide an SVG, but if you'd like to bring your critter, or create/source your own SVG - go for it!

I recommend using [affinity designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/)
